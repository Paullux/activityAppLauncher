# ActivityAppLauncher #

A gnome shell extension that add a category-based application launcher to the Activities view

Note: the dash has been moved to the bottom and converted in a dock thanks to ["Dash to dock"](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/307/dash-to-dock/) extension, which is NOT part of activityAppLauncher.
